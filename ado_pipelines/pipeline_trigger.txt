v1.10.4 release trigger 

To start a release build on Azure:

1. Edit this file, setting vx.y.z to your desired release tag
2. Commit on a new branch names releases/vx.y.z
3. If all goes well, release artifacts will be completed in about 3 hours.  

Note:  The ACR images are pushed incrementally as the pipeline runs, starting with Blocks. The zip files on guthub are pushed at the 
end of the pipeline in one update.
