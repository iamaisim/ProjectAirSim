# Introduction
This folder is intended to house the client scripts for Project AirSim that behave identically or similarly to the scripts housed in the PythonClient folder that work for AirSim OSS.

# Conventions
Mirror scripts: We will call the relationship between two scripts that do the same thing, one for Project AirSim and the other for AirSim OSS, as mirrors.

# Rules
To maintain a correspondence between scripts, the script inside this folder must have the same relative location as its mirror script in the PythonClient folder. The name of two mirror scripts must be the same
